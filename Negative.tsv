has failed in it very badly	total waste of time and effort	I have seen worst movies than this	instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way																									
really a new low in entertainment	there are a lot worse movies out	hard to have a convincing storyline (this movies does not	couldn't be more far fetched and worn out cliché	would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.)	not giving the characters a moment to reflect	forcing the story along the path where they want it to be	it is nothing more then a cheap action movie	managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation	can't recommend it	1 for Vinnie and 2 for the editing.

the worst movie ever made	It beats everything	have never seen worse	Retire the trophy and give it to these people.....there's just no comparison	how insanely horrific this movie is/was	Its so bad	story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence	made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good	made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe	movie sincerely hurts us as a society	should be ashamed	cannot emphasize	need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions	It's an embarrassment	don't know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film sleeps at night	what type of disgusting monsters	this crosses the line of "bad"	his is awkward bad	This is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen	cheesy editing	shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point	This is meticulously boring, repetitive and just tortures the audience	DISTURBING thing	inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad	will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this	Stop these movies	most vile of all facets	Please.

psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy	not my cup of tea	too long																										
quickly becomes tiresome	is a total bore and would appeal to no one	too hip and "with it" to be understood by us mortals																										
didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town	no background traffic or lookie loos	lousy direction	rape scene brutal and unnecessary	sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad	some glitches in the film	low-caliber of the film																						
movie was terrible	acting was TERRIBLE	actor were almost camera shy	plot was also crap	writers were probably sleep deprived	good kind of bad movie	how terrible the movie was	i think everybody should watch this, so that then we could appreciate better other, REAL, movies																					
No offense but I thought it was all for nothing	film had no script	demanded next to nothing	film was another failure	script was so bad	nothing to sink your teeth into	all the characters were two dimensional	tried to act like a hard ass	script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough	sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns	It was really weird	didn't sound like real guns	video game had better sound effects than this film	really annoying bloke	He sounded like a girl	Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film	Poor Madsen												
was a tough to bear experience believe me	is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre	hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find																										
such a shame of a film	if your script and dialogs are terrible	even good actors cannot save the day	amateur actors that flood this film	oo many non-native-English-speakers play parts of native-English-speakers	reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away	It's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound	music is awful and totally out of place	whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play	I recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other, better, movies	This is why I gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves

a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale	what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low	this many clichés and still be entertained	OH MY GOD What are we going to do!?

film is terrible	If you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie)	acting is horrendous	serious amateur hour	new low	plot is terrible	this is a terrible movie	Don't watch it!!!	at least you won't feel like killing yourself																				
too dry and too theatrical	less cinema	too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art	story has a level of ambiguity	means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task	classical film treatment that betrays the director	seem confused	lack credibility	bad imitation of Hitchcock in the late 30s	too demonstrative	try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is																		
did not like the idea of the female turtle	old TMNT series was much more better than that new one	to have a female turtle is a very weak point																										
is the biggest insult to TMNT ever	There will never be a female turtle	turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character	could have done such a better job	don't bother with this people	it's cringe worthy material	the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking	totally disrespected shredder	dragonlord dude was corny	the turtles looked corny	the silly looking	got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds	better writing it could have been good																
was disappointed by the end result is an understatement	not the greatest piece of puppetry	ever got comfortable with her	against the idea of one who uses magic	execution was flawed																								
is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned	it was deuce	It's atrocious	hate on the series for including a female turtle	it's miserably forgettable																								
disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie	plot itself is just STUPID!!!	Ridiculous!!!	If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this																									
as placed on the 'Video Nasties' list	officially classed as obscene & banned	is so boring it's untrue	kidnap plot is one of the dullest	without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved	horror side of things don't improve	it has no more success	is one to avoid	shows his usual incompetence throughout	cannibal scenes are poor	action is lame	endless scenes of people randomly walking around	incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes	this is very tame	ome gross close ups of the cannibals mouth	fair bit of nudity	an unpleasant rape scene	must have had a low budget & I mean low	shoddy poorly made film	awful special effects	rock bottom production values	music sucks	sound effects become annoying	acting sucks	no one in this thing can act	is a terrible film	commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell	are pretty gross	should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible
seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes	too much footage of people walking	Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained	gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs																									
gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list	isn't the tamest of the bunch	which is a shame	never would have sat through it	film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes	there really aren't many scenes of interest	It's a real shame	unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap	really is no reason to bother with this one																				
film features tons of nudity	1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops	some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes	one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs																									
copious amounts of nudity and violence	violence against nude people	this movie is a snoozer	pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out	Worst of all, almost no one says anything	Its such a quiet and dull movie	recommend this as a sleep aide	This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep																					
this really isn't one of his best efforts	drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening	Devil Hunter is poorly lit	adly dubbed, poorly acted and slow	hilariously bad scenes in it	There is not much reason to watch this film	cenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them																						
How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course!	hilarity of it all	the movie is just bad	don't' bother																									
least deserving of notoriety	dreadfully dull jungle clunker	a gratuitous rape scene	loads of nudity	crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing																								
??																												
sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie	plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films	The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico	tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb	just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp	To make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore	no real scares	a lot of unnecessary penis	Not fun	this one just fell WAY short	2 out of 10																		
his little pile of garbage	pilot is one of the worst actors EVER!	are all totally terrible	the dubbing will make you cry blood	some of the worst makeup ever	ping-pong balls for eyes	that's pretty much it	I found myself muting much of those scenes	constant nudity	shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well	can't recommend this trash to anyone	not even the good bad movie	just atrociously padded trash																
is a very low budget movie	demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner																											
king of so-called 'eurotrash'	rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word	film's title is misleading	makes it sound pretty awful, and it is	baldly outrageous	with nudity and sleaze and violence	stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made	they're so very tedious	incomprehensible	lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole	repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away	all retarded	dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable	Not too much really happens	happens pretty sluggishly	odd bit of outrage like a rape	Lazy, crazy Franco												
more of a made for TV movie	there are no subtitles	key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish	will be left a little lost	doesn't exactly light up the screen	really not worth it	also isn't screen stealing either																						
very cheesy and dull road movie	some weird camera angles	resulting only in sleepiness	ast is wasted	writing is stupid and pretentious	bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved	it is really pure garbage	save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do																					
predictable twists	Predictable	VERY obvious	badly done and extremely slow	Even at 30 minutes this is too long	barely a horror story	not even remotely scary	It ends very stupidly																					
this film was a major letdown	level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing	some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited	main characters were impossible to identify	protagonist's character was as slimy	nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war	this is not realistic	same-sex attraction as a lurid "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled	the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles																				
I was total disappointed and furious	Too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing	is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history	advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film																									
not so delighted to have seen it	is shockingly violent	the characters are just so dang *weird*	motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent	it descends into some horrific wretched excess	LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood	potboiler	SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!!	not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable	a bizarre and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction."	feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom																		
only good thing about this movie	Ooooof!	that shot nearly killed me																										
only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and "The Man who Fell to Earth."	script is insulting to anyone	completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone getting shot in the butt	vapid and moronic	offensive stereotypes about Arabs	acting was terrible	The worst																						
Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility	unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest	Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal																										
nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch	When I say that PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what I'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? Exactly																											
you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde	Protocol is simply unfunny	Whatever humour exists is tired and strained	relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men	the film is no more successful	Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as "Cactus Flower", "Overboard" and ""Housesitter", but "Protocol" is not one of them	this dire comedy is by far the worst	3/10.																					
only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors	story goes downhill halfway through the movie	Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie	don't go out of your way to see this film																									
film never really hits it a stride	just goes on for too long and really has no purpose	preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste	don't think this scene added to the movie at all	don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson	written by some '60's burn out	not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!																						
not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys"	Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back	noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is	hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off	semi-incoherent Matthau	Matthau was still too young for this role	over-compensates by slouching and hollering	Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf	picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace	ne loses hope for it early on	1/2.																		
it's also a mess	main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals	the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy	projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning	a trashy scene indeed!	wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator	some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time	lousy production	trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing	warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!																			
Holy crap	was the worst film I have seen	there is no plot	Really! No plot!	character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over	film got upto a six because people think they should like it	the actual complete work is a steamy turd	in this film NOTHING HAPPENS! Sack																					
movie was awful	ending was absolutely horrible	There was no plot to the movie	movie did not do their acting performances any justice	If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching	performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof	waiting throughout the movie for something to happen	not just utterless dialog between characters	There was nothing special about any of the characters	Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie	wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning	It wasn't even a story	entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time	grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie															
I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10	became a total farce	so many clichés in that flick	women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake	no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits	It's not funny enough to be a comedy	it's too fake-sad to really touch	it's just not good	one of the oddest movies I've ever seen																				
I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all. Okay!																												
political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed	the outcome is entirely predictable	Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that	never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens	found the film a real chore to watch	It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more																							
this movie is awful	It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America	Ned was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent	it is the worst film I have seen in a long time																									
this was a very clunky	this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story	the whole thing felt forced and mechanical	beginning could have been a lot more involving	I felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted	like a very bad tv soap	hoping for something a lot better																						
listened to the critics and passed on this one.	the movie was very disappointing	The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in	failed to develop much empathy for the characters	I do not recommend this film	It won't satisfy even that	had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end																						
movie was so unrelentingly bad	could hardly believe I was watching it	seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies	no narrative flow that made any sort of sense	big emotional moments and climaxes and character relationships come completely out of no where	are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film		making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them	the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances	diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell	plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic	A failure all around	because it was still bad																
ails to distinguish himself in the title role	providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging	doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice-over narration	underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.	same old story told with different accents.	feels awfully familiar and unoriginal	What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that																						
worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while	He looked deformed	looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set	This is a far cry	This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring	only stayed because we were convinced it would get better	talking about what a waste of time this film was	It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.																					
silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt	Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD	I'll give it 3/10																										
quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious	albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version	Ned Kelly is nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe	never has a film plodded so slowly	The story plods along at an alarming rate	feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel	nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing	you're gonna be disappointed	fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty),	film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots	is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff	should have gone straight to TV	isn't even one good word I can say about this film	Even the usually fantastic Rush seems embarrassed to be here	wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head														
shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring	they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script	story is utterly without any literary depth at all	told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards	doesn't work as a popcorn film either	pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner	story has failed miserably on the big screen																						
the plot was paper thin	can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story	doesn't inspire me to read "Our Sunshine"																										
had nothing to do with the story	It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school	story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason	too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story	team didn't really know what they were doing	this was by far the worst	just wanted to warn others not to start with this one																						
that won't do for the TV series	Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble	All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too	they had to put something in to fill the time	this episode is a victim of style over content																								
found it to be absolutely idiotic	seemed so ridiculous	Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought	She was very irritating	this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting																								
stupid	plot was senseless	acting was terrible	waste of two hours of my life																									
movie sucked	waste of my life	acting was atrocious	complete joke																									
not at all appealing	made no sense																											
plot was stupid	bit boring	incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic																										
Unfortunately	miss out	boring mess	cheaper	confusing scene	doesn't make much sense	bad lines, really bad acting	cheesy effects, and poor direction	2 out of 10																				
pains me	below average rating	under-exploited	plot is predictable	acting mediocre	editing atrocious																							
highly disappointed	story line was so twisted	far fetch	I just couldn't enjoy it	movie was a downer																								
would be much better	Too many scenes out of context	better care at editing	story was all over the place	didn't seem to have a center																								
strays further and further	worst one		story line is no where in the book	great disservice	music is too loud	actors are not convincing	lack emotions	 Don't watch it																				
very disappointed	sad and depressing	to many goofs	editing was very poor	to many scenes out of context	didn't seem to fit	lacking emotion	slips further and further away	my least favorite																				
worse than a home video	just horrible	worst movie																										
Buyer beware																												
most of the garbage	tons of filler.	looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone																										
ABSOLUTE waste of time	Worse still	isn't a 'fun' movie	aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue	unimaginative, badly-conceived junk	3-D format is utterly wasted																							
couldn't tell where I was in this movie	couldn't pay long enough attention	acting was just horrible	BAD movie	non-sense style 	skip this one																							
worst movie 	awful plot	Awful simply awful
