only good thing about this movie	Ooooof!	that shot nearly killed me																											
only two movies I would give a 1/10 to	script is insulting	completely lost me	vapid and moronic	offensive stereotypes about Arabs	acting was terrible	The worst																							
Outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility	unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest																												
nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch	not being up to scratch ?																												
you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one	Protocol is simply unfunny	Whatever humour exists is tired and strained	relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men	the film is no more successful	but "Protocol" is not one of them	this dire comedy is by far the worst	3/10.

I can't say I enjoyed it						I didn't look at it all																							
so obvious and heavy handed	entirely predictable	In this film you will find none of that	never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens	real chore to watch	put me off watching any more																								
this movie is awful	It's an Australian story yet it seems like it was set in America	was an Australian yet he has an Irish accent	it is the worst film I have seen in a long time																										
this was a very clunky	clunky, uninvolving version	the whole thing felt forced and mechanical	beginning could have been a lot more involving	routinely predictable and signposted	like a very bad tv soap	hoping for something a lot better																							
listened to the critics and passed on this one.	the movie was very disappointing	slow moving	failed to develop much empathy for the characters	I do not recommend this film	It won't satisfy even that	had to fight the urge to fast-forward						never pulled me in																	
movie was so unrelentingly bad	could hardly believe I was watching it	done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies	no narrative flow that made any sort of sense	completely out of no where	are not set up like they would have been		making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection	the terrible writing cancels out	diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell	plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic	A failure all around	because it was still bad																	
fails to distinguish himself in the title role	providing little in the way of substance	forced to provide a droning voice-over narration	underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness	same old story told with different accents.	feels awfully familiar and unoriginal	What movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that																							
worst piece of garbage	He looked deformed	looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set	This is a far cry	This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring	only stayed because we were convinced it would get better	talking about what a waste of time this film was	It cost me 2 hours of my life																						
silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt	Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD	3/10																											
quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious	albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version	nothing more than an overblown Hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe	never has a film plodded so slowly	The story plods along at an alarming rate	feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel	nothing happens in the film	you're gonna be disappointed	fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty),	film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots	is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff	should have gone straight to TV	isn't even one good word I can say about this film	seems embarrassed to be here	wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head															
shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring	they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script	story is utterly without any literary depth at all	told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards	doesn't work as a popcorn film either	pacing is too off-kilter	story has failed miserably on the big screen					its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner																		
the plot was paper thin	can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story	doesn't inspire me to read "Our Sunshine"																											
had nothing to do with the story	It's something I would have done my 1st year in film school	seemed to drag on for no apparent reason	too many things just thrown in there 	team didn't really know what they were doing	this was by far the worst	just wanted to warn others not to start with this one						had nothing to do with the story																	
that won't do for the TV series	was feeble	All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too	they had to put something in to fill the time	victim of style over content

stupid	plot was senseless	acting was terrible	waste of two hours of my life																										
movie sucked	waste of my life	acting was atrocious	complete joke																										
not at all appealing	made no sense																												
plot was stupid	bit boring	incomprehensible					the end is totally chaotic

pains me	below average rating	under-exploited	plot is predictable	acting mediocre	editing atrocious																								
highly disappointed	story line was so twisted	far fetch	I just couldn't enjoy it	movie was a downer																									
would be much better	Too many scenes out of context	better care at editing	story was all over the place	didn't seem to have a center																									
strays further and further	worst one		story line is no where in the book	great disservice	music is too loud	actors are not convincing	lack emotions	 Don't watch it																					
very disappointed	sad and depressing	to many goofs	editing was very poor	to many scenes out of context	didn't seem to fit	lacking emotion	slips further and further away	my least favorite																					
worse than a home video	just horrible	worst movie																											
Buyer beware																													
most of the garbage	tons of filler.	been filmed on someone's mobile phone																											
ABSOLUTE waste of time	Worse still	isn't a 'fun' movie	aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue	unimaginative, badly-conceived junk	3-D format is utterly wasted																								
couldn't tell where I was in this movie	couldn't pay long enough attention	acting was just horrible	BAD movie	non-sense style 	skip this one
